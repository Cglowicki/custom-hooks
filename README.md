### Note :  There is a branch for each example. Switch to the branch you want to see

- From the React Docs: 
  > Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.
- Custom hooks let us move repetitive or complex code out of our components
- You can think of Custom hooks as "helper functions" for React
- Custom hooks can, and often do, use other React hooks (useState, useffect, etc)
- React Rule: All React Hooks must start with the prefix "use" 
- Multiple instances of the same custom hook do not share state
- A Custom Hook can return anything you want (value, array, object, function)
